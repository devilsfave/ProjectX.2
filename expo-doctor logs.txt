The package "expo-modules-autolinking" should not be installed directly in your project. It is a dependency of other Expo packages, which will install it automatically as needed.
Advice: Add '/android' and '/ios' to your .gitignore file if you intend to use CNG / Prebuild. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild/#usage-with-eas-build

Advice: Use 'npx expo install --check' to review and upgrade your dependencies.
